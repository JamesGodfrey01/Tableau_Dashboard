# Tableau General Health Dashboard

This is a Tableau packaged workbook dashboard displaying the general health of the population by region, local authority, sex, and age.

The data used to make this dashboard is publicly available from the UK census 2011 and 2021.

The sheets used to create the dashboard are hidden â€“ unhide them if you wish. :)
